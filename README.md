## Executive Summary
The Employee Attrition Analysis project aims to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover in an organization. By analyzing various aspects such as job roles, education fields, and salary hikes, we provide insights into the patterns and trends associated with employee attrition. This analysis helps the organization develop targeted strategies to retain talent and improve employee satisfaction.

## Business Problem
Employee attrition is a significant concern for organizations, leading to increased recruitment and training costs, loss of expertise, and disruptions in workflow. Understanding the drivers behind employee turnover is crucial for developing effective retention strategies. This project seeks to address the following questions:

1. What are the primary factors contributing to employee attrition?
2. Which job roles, education fields, and demographic groups are most affected?
3. How do salary hikes influence attrition rates?

## Methodology

**Data Cleaning:** Ensured data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed trends and patterns in the data using visualizations.
**Statistical Analysis:** Employed statistical methods to identify significant factors influencing attrition.
**Visualization:** Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key findings and trends.

## Skills Utilized
**Data Analysis:** SQL, Excel
**Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis
**Data Visualization:** Power BI
**Business Intelligence:** Strategic insights and recommendations

## Results & Business Recommendations
### Key Findings:

**Attrition Rate:** The overall attrition rate is 16.1%.
**High-Risk Groups:** Employees in sales executive roles, with certain education fields like life sciences, and those with lower salary hikes, show higher attrition rates.
